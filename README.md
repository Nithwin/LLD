# Low-Level Design System Design Questions

A comprehensive collection of 50 Low-Level Design (LLD) system design questions with implementations in both Java and C++. This repository is designed for collaborative learning and contribution.

## Overview

This repository contains carefully curated LLD questions organized into five categories, each focusing on different aspects of system design and software engineering principles.

## Question Categories

### 1. Design Patterns (10 Questions)
Object-oriented design patterns and their practical implementations.

### 2. Data Structures (10 Questions)
Custom data structure implementations with specific requirements and constraints.

### 3. System Components (10 Questions)
Complete system designs for common real-world components.

### 4. Real-world Applications (10 Questions)
End-to-end application designs mimicking production systems.

### 5. Concurrency (10 Questions)
Thread-safe implementations and concurrent programming challenges.
