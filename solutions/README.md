## Contributing Solutions

When submitting a solution:

1. Navigate to the appropriate category folder for your language
2. Create a folder named `<question-name>/<your-id>/`
3. Add your solution files and README.md
4. Follow the solution template in `/templates/`

Example:
```
solutions/java/design-patterns/singleton-logger/john123/
├── Logger.java
├── LogLevel.java
├── Main.java
└── README.md
```

## Naming Conventions

- Use your GitHub username or unique ID for your solution folder
- Follow language-specific naming for code files

## Code Quality

All solutions should:
- Compile without errors
- Include proper documentation
- Follow coding standards
- Handle edge cases
- Include test cases where applicable

Happy coding!
